# Xamarin Project - Survival Basics

## Authors: Alan Hung

### About Application
This application is your basic Application that provides your basic needs if you ever get lost while hiking.  It provides a compass that will always point to North, a Button that will turn on your phone camera's light, and a display to estimate the amount of time you have left in your battery life.
